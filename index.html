                            Social stratification plays a crucial role in determining how structural barriers and societal institutions in the personal, private, and professional social sectors limit an individual's socioeconomic trajectory in society. This stratification, influenced by several ascribed and achieved social characteristics, significantly impacts an individual's social mobility. For minority populations, this often means an increasing amount of social vulnerability due to socioeconomic stratification, racism, and inequality. Social stratification effectively confines minority populations to specific social outcomes and characteristic patterns, such as federal, state, or local trends, that can provide statistically significant correlations to the relationship between social vulnerability, socioeconomic outcomes, and residential region.

                            The first model (Model 1) assesses the direct effects of employment status and education level on the SVI score.

This model aims to test for moderation, exploring whether the relationship between education attainment and an individual's SVI score differs depending on employment status. By including interaction terms, Model 2 allowed for an assessment of how the effect of education attainment on an individual's SVI score might be moderated by whether an individual is employed or unemployed.

                            The results from Model 1 indicate that employment status significantly affects the SVI score, with unemployed individuals showing a higher average SVI score. The coefficient for the unemployed is positive and statistically significant, suggesting that unemployment is associated with increased social vulnerability. However, the direct effects of education level on the SVI score are less clear. The coefficient for education High School Graduates is very small and statistically insignificant, indicating no meaningful effect. Similarly, the negative coefficients for education College and education Graduate suggest that higher levels of education are associated with slightly lower SVI scores. However, these effects are also minor and lack strong significance.

                            In contrast, Model 2, which includes interaction terms, shows that while the main effect of employment status remains significant, the interaction between education and employment status provides further nuance. Specifically, the interaction term for unemployed high school graduates is marginally significant, implying that the effect of unemployment on the SVI score may slightly differ for individuals with a high school education compared to others. However, the interaction terms for college-educated respondents and employment status are not statistically significant, suggesting that the relationship between education attainment and social vulnerability is not strongly influenced by employment status for these groups. Therefore, whether or not a highly educated individual is employed, their social vulnerability remains largely unchanged.

                            Individuals with higher education attainment, such as high school graduates and college-educated respondents, maintained significantly higher SVI scores compared to those with less than a high school education. Furthermore, unemployed individuals demonstrated a modest but statistically significant increase in social vulnerability compared to employed individuals. No statistically significant interaction effects were identified, suggesting that the impact of education on social vulnerability does not vary significantly based on employment status.

                            While the relationships observed were statistically significant, the results indicate that education attainment and employment status explain only a small proportion of the variation in social vulnerability amongst respondents. These findings support the test hypothesis, as statistically significant relationships were identified between social vulnerability, education attainment, and employment status. However, the model's limited explanatory strength suggests more complex relationships are melding together to increase social vulnerability in some respondents and not others depite these findings.
